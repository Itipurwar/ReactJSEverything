## 🌐 Context API

Learned to manage global state in React using **Context API**.  
Key points include:

- Sharing state across multiple components without prop drilling  
- Creating and using Context Providers  
- Consuming context with `useContext` hook  
- Simplifying state management in medium-sized applications  

💡 Makes React apps cleaner and easier to maintain by avoiding deeply nested props.
