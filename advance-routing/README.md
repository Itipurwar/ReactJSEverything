## 🚀 Advanced Routing

Implemented advanced routing techniques in React using **React Router v6**.  
This includes:

- Nested routes for organizing components hierarchically  
- Dynamic route parameters for handling variable paths  
- Protected routes for authentication and role-based access  
- Programmatic navigation using hooks like `useNavigate`  

💡 Enables building scalable, multi-page React applications with smooth navigation.
